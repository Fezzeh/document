 #### Learning_Git 
 1. now that I want to learn *linux* i need to learn how to work with **git**.
 2. so, first of all, I need to visit *Github* website "www.github.com".
 3. Then, at "https://github.com/new" address, I create a new repository and name it whatever i want.
 4. then, at the terminal, get the ssh key and put it in Setting>deploy keys....
 5. cloning the repository in a directory, I need to write a command on my terminal at ubuntu desktop as, *git clone ""SSH Address"*
 6. Then, command ls on directory in which we cloned our repository.
 7. command cat the repository. 
 8. markdown the steps of creating the reposity 
 9. git add ""File""
 10. git commit -m"the changes i've made on the file"
 11. git push origin "name of branch"
 12. The branch can be "main" or "whatever I created"
 13. to see the branches on the repository the command ""git branch" should be used.
 14. to create a new branch on the repository the command ""git checkout -b "name of branch" "" should be used.
 15. to switch between branches the command ""git checkout "branch" ""
 should be used.
